## Introduction

This Python Password Manager is a command-line application that allows users to securely store, retrieve, and generate passwords. It's designed with security in mind and implements industry-standard practices for password hashing and encryption.
I always find it hard to remember different passwords of my different services,so i tried to make same kind of password for different services.Also I don't change my old password overtime which makes me more vulnerable.
I created a place where i can store my passwords pairing with their services in a secure way,and i could generate strong passwords and change my passwords overtime,which makes me some what feel safe! 

## Features

- A simple user authentication system
- Secure password storage
- Password retrieval
- Password generation
- Password strength checking
- Command-line interface for easy interaction

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-password-manager.git
   cd python-password-manager
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Password Manager, use the following command:

```
python main.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to:
1. Register a new user
2. Log in
3. Add a new password
4. Retrieve a stored password
5. Generate a new password

## Security Considerations

- User authentication passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 with SHA256, which is resistant to rainbow table and brute-force attacks.
- Stored passwords are encrypted before being saved to the JSON file.
- The application uses strong random number generation for password creation.


Note: While we've implemented several security measures, this project is for educational purposes. For a production environment, additional security measures and a more secure storage solution would be necessary.
